# HRECURS---Hello-Recursion

HRECURS - Hello Recursion
You will be given an array of N integers. Write a recursive function to calculate its summation.

####Input

Input starts with an integer T (T ≤ 100), the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines will start with an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), number of integers followed by N space separated. Each of these N integers will be between -1000 and 1000 (inclusive).

####Output For each test case, output one line in the format “Case x: a” (quotes for clarity), where x is the case number and a is the summation of the integers.

Sample Input
Input:
2
5 10 5 -2 3 0
3 100 -10 34
Sample Output
Output:
Case 1: 16
Case 2: 124
Explanation
You just have to get the sum, which is an easy in task iteratively. Try it recursively.
